# RISC-V Bare Metal Tiny OS
Coding RISC-V bare metal boot loader and exokernel OS for education purposes.

## Goal
Learn how to build minimal OS for RISC-V architecture:
- Source code should be small and self-explanatory. Aim at 2-3 files.
- No external dependencies except the RISC-V GNU toolchain.
- Load and execture ELF binary in User Space. Trap invalid operations without crashing the whole machine.
- Small RAM memory footprint. Aim below 16KB.
- Run on real hardware such as SiFive E baord.
- Run small user space "hello world" program. Playable "Tetris" as a stretch goal!
